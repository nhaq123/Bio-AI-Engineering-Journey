## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a First-Year Engineering Student (AI & ML) with a unique background in **Biology**.

Coming from a Tier-3 college, I am self-engineering my own curriculum to master the intersection of **Life Sciences** and **Machine Learning**. My goal is not just to write code, but to build tools that understand, simulate, and predict biological phenomena—from DNA sequences to protein structures.

This repository is a live documentation of my engineering sprints.

## 🗺️ Current Roadmap

My curriculum follows a "Lego Strategy"—every concept learned is immediately applied to a biological problem.

| Timeline | Tech Focus | Bio-Application | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Month 01** | Jan 2026 | **Python Foundation** | **The Central Dogma Toolkit** (DNA/RNA Logic) | 🟡 *In Progress* |
