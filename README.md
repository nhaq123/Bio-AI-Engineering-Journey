# Month 01 — Python Foundation & The Central Dogma Toolkit 🧬🐍

**Focus:** Core Python logic, data structures, and biological sequence manipulation.  
**Curriculum:** Angela Yu (Days 1–25) + Custom Bio-AI engineering projects.  
**Status:** In progress

---

## 🎯 Mission
Move beyond tutorial exercises by immediately applying Python fundamentals to computational biology.  
Build a small, reusable library — **The Central Dogma Toolkit** — that models simple cellular processes (mutation, transcription, translation) and ingests real biological data.
